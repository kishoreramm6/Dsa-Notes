## 1. Basic Math Notes
- ## **Palindrome**
  1. Boundary Condition
  ### x<0 == 0||x%10==0 &x!=0    Return Flase
             x=100
              now  revrese the digit 001 , example what ever no we take if end with zero it cannot be palindrome
            Aswell as negative digit too
            before going to loop we need to check need condition are statifyb are not if statify go to loop or not 
 - ## GCD
           we have varies Method use
            But optimal Approach is  Educian Algo
            GCD(a,b) = GCD(a%b,b) if a>b
            until one of them
   - ## ArmStrong

           153 is Armstrong because
              1 ^3 + 5^3+ +3 ^3 = 153
               int temp = n%10;
                   n1= n1/10;
                num =num + (int) Math.pow(temp,3)
   Complexity - O(log(n))
